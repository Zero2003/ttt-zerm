# ttt-zerm
 TTT Endroundmusic that's simple and easily deployable.

# Installing
Put into /garrysmod/addons and let the server do the rest of the work.
For any new sounds, simply put them into the folder /garrysmod/addons/ttt-zerm/sound/tttmusic/ROLE/file.mp3
Replace ROLE with what team you want the sound to play with once they win.

# NOTES
Files must be an MP3 or they will not be loaded or pushed to clients.
If you know how to use gmod's workshop, it's a better option to put the sound files onto a custom workshop and add the workshop item to your downloads, as they will go by a lot faster that way.
